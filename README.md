## Step 1: Rule Out the ‚ÄúEasy Fixes‚Äù

Before diving into advanced recovery, check the basics:

- **Refresh & Resync Mycelium**  
  Toggle airplane mode on/off, reopen the app, and ensure a stable Wi-Fi connection.  
- **Check Multiple Accounts**  
  Switch through tabs like *Account 1, Imported, HD* ‚Äî funds might sit under another account.  
- **Verify Network**  
  Ensure you‚Äôre on **Bitcoin mainnet** (not Testnet).  
- **Check Transactions on a Block Explorer**  
  Paste your receiving address or TXID into [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) to confirm status.

## Step 2: Restore from Your Seed (Safest Method)

If balances still don‚Äôt appear, perform a clean restore:

1. Locate your **12/24-word BIP39 seed** (check spelling & order carefully).  
2. Download **Mycelium Wallet** from the **official source only** (never random APK sites).  
3. Open Mycelium ‚Üí **Restore Wallet** ‚Üí Choose BIP39/HD if prompted.  
4. Enter your seed phrase and let the wallet **fully rescan**.  
   - Large histories may take longer ‚Äî don‚Äôt close the app.  

üí° *If you had a BIP39 passphrase (‚Äú25th word‚Äù), you must enter it exactly to see your funds.*

## Step 3: Fix ‚ÄúBalance Not Showing‚Äù After Restore

Sometimes balances don‚Äôt display after restoring. Common reasons:

- **Wrong Derivation Path**  
  - Legacy (BIP44, 1‚Ä¶ addresses)  
  - Nested SegWit (BIP49, 3‚Ä¶ addresses)  
  - Native SegWit (BIP84, bc1‚Ä¶ addresses)  

- **Gap Limit Issue**  
  If you created many addresses, generate new ones or use a wallet that increases the gap limit.  

- **Change Address Confusion**  
  Funds may appear only after a full rescan.  

- **Unconfirmed or Replaced Transactions**  
  Low-fee or RBF-enabled transactions may take time or be replaced.  

---

## Step 4: Confirm Ownership on the Blockchain

To confirm your Bitcoin is safe:

- Copy your **receiving address** into a public explorer like [mempool.space](https://mempool.space).  
- If funds appear there but not in Mycelium ‚Üí adjust wallet settings (path/type/gap limit).  
- If funds don‚Äôt appear ‚Üí double-check sender‚Äôs TXID and the address used.  

---

## Step 5: Advanced Recovery Checks

- **Seed vs. Imported Keys**  
  If you imported a private key separately, restore that key too.  
- **BIP39 Passphrase**  
  Funds won‚Äôt show without the exact extra passphrase if used.  
- **Security Practices**  
  Never type your seed into browser sites unless fully offline and trusted.

## Step 6: When to Contact Support

If recovery still fails:  

- Document everything:  
  - First Mycelium address, TXIDs, wallet settings, screenshots.  
- Try a companion wallet (Electrum or BlueWallet) for a deep scan.  
- Contact Mycelium support (but **never share your full seed/private keys**).  

---

## Common Reasons Funds Appear ‚ÄúMissing‚Äù

- Restored seed into wrong wallet/app.  
- Wrong address type (Legacy vs. SegWit).  
- Balance hidden in change addresses until sync completes.  
- Pending transaction due to low fee.  
- Typo in receive address (rare).
